# numericalProject2

This program is written in MATLAB environment and returns the eigenvalue of the tridiagonal matrix 'A', that is closest to the given value 'u'. 
To accomplish this I use an inverse power method with normalization. To factorize and solve matrix 'A - u * I', where 'I' is identity matrix, I use Givens rotation. 
The full specification and explanation is in the 'P2Z13_PJA_findEigenvalue.m' file.
