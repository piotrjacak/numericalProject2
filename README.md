# numericalProject2

This program is written in MATLAB environment and returns the eigenvalue of the tridiagonal matrix 'A', that is closest to the given value 'u'. 
To accomplish this it uses an inverse power method with normalization. To factorize and solve matrix 'A - u * I', where 'I' is identity matrix, it uses Givens rotation. 
The full specification and explanation is in the 'P2Z13_PJA_findEigenvalue.m' file.
